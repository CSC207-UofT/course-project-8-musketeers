## Part 1: Principles of Universal Design

### Equitable Use:
Our program is not hard to use, so the learning curve is quite low if it exists. Those with disabilities may use special devices to input their data. As long as the devices input is interpreted by the computer to be identical to typing and/or moving the cursor, our program should not have any trouble accommodating them. (Example: Speech to text will input data into CLI, but our program is responsible for interpreting the data and not the speech, so there isn’t an issue). Given the actual program is just a graphing calculator, there is little accommodation to be made as there are no actual expectations of the ability of the user.

### Flexibility in Use:

Our program is a graphing calculator, therefore this principle is mostly handled by the computer’s available accessibility options. For example, left-handed or right-handed use is a physical accommodation our program cannot account for. We have different viewing modes of graphs, each with their own style. So a user has the choice of how he wants the equation that is graphed to be represented. It is a simple to use program, so there are little to none accommodations to be made to allow for more demographics to use it.

### Simple and Intuitive Use:

Our program is pretty simple. We have a range of the commands that our program can interpret, and we have a clear explanation of how to use each. For example, type “-eq” to specify that you will be typing an equation, type “-graph” to graph the function. Our commands are intuitively clear, and simple to use. Given we are graphing functions, there are also possibilities for lots of weird, invalid input. We hope to extend our program so that we can return clearer error messages that are more specific to what caused the invalid cases and referring to them specifically instead of letting the program crash and return an exception that gives a general idea of what was the issue with the input.

### Perceptible Information:
Since we are graphing equations, the graphs themselves must be clear. Our current program makes the graphs have high contrast with the surroundings (which are the grid lines), but we hope to include the feature to color the graphs as you like to accommodate those with color blindness. Our shaders are also currently only black and white, so we can change that to allow for any combination of colors. The name of the graph would also show up when we hover the cursor over it, allowing for the user to comfortably refer to the graph they want in the case where they are graphing multiple equations.

### Tolerance for Error:

For the most part, this does not really apply to our program. Graphing calculators aren’t inherently dangerous. However, based on user feedback, we can learn how cumbersome our commands are and change the way we present our information (and the ability to graph). For example, instead of including “-domain” after the equation to represent the domain, would it be a cleaner option to just have the user use curly brackets {} instead?

### Low Physical effort:

Zooming in and out uses only the keyboard up and down buttons, which is low effort. We can move around the graph by dragging the screen with the cursor, which does not take much effort. Zooming in and out allows for less strain on the eyes. Users can choose how zoomed in they want to be.

### Size and Space for Approach and Use:

High contrast colors allow for seeing the graphs clearly, therefore graphs can be seen from many angles allowing for the user to adjust their screen to where they are most comfortable. Labels for graph allow for easy identification of the graph. Zooming in and out allow for user to see more accurate values of the graph without having to take out their magnifying glasses and straining their eyes.

## PART 2: AUDIENCE

Our group is comprised of math students, so we wanted our project to be about something related to math. So we decided on a graphing calculator, which represented a lot of the work we do in math. So naturally, we would market this program towards math students and students of other related sciences. We think that the project should be free, however. Graphing software is somewhat figured out, and we think that the features we provide should be accessible by everyone. We would definitely want to have it licensed though. In its fully realized state, our program should be a very useful tool for students in university, and even high schoolers. If given time to fully realize the project idea we had in the beginning, we would include many more features that would be useful for those in math, engineering, economics, and any other areas of study where graphing is useful for intuition.

## PART 3: Demographic
Given our project is very visually intensive with no other cues, those with visual impairments like blindness are much less likely to use our project. Demographics where graphing is not related to their life are also much less likely to use our project. Such demographics include: The elderly who are not academically active, actors, musicians, athletes, and so on.
