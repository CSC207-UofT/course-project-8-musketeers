# Project Abacus

### Progress Report

Our group has completed all of the phase 0 tasks, including specification, CRC cards, scenario, and a basic skeleton program.
The code is able to generate detailed imagery for pre-configured “graphs”, in both 2D and 3D with examples provided. 
There is also a rigid plan for an Abstract Syntax Tree, which will be the method used to store expressions in order to graph them. 

#### Specification

A User should be able to:

- actually evaluate basic expressions like 3 + 5

- graph functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ and restrict its domain
- graph functions in 3D, so $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ and again be able to restrict domains
- graph implicit functions, i.e. functions of the form $f(x,y) = 0$ and $f(x, y, z) = 0$.
- plot multiple graphs on the same set of axes
- do operations on the functions they define, i.e. if they have a function $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, they should be able to plot $f(x) + g(x), f(x) - g(x), f(x)g(x), \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}, f(g(x))$ 
- zoom in and out of graph
- be able to rotate viewpoint around for 3D graphs

Possible extensions:

- Plotting parametric curves and surfaces
- Plotting complex functions
- Plotting vector fields
- Finding derivatives and integrals

#### Scenario Walk-through
A user inputs an expression like `f(x) = x^2 + 5`. First an empty `Backend.Axes` object is created. This is passed on to `Backend.ExpressionReader`. The `Backend.ExpressionReader` converts `x^2 + 5` into a list `[“x”, “^”, “2”, “+”, “5”]` and passes that on to `Backend.ExpressionCreator`. `Backend.ExpressionCreator` will convert all the variables, operators and numbers into appropriate `Expressions` (`Backend.NumberExpression`, `Backend.VariableExpression`, `Backend.OperatorExpression`) and combines them into an Abstract Syntax Tree, then create a `Backend.FunctionExpression` that stores the function name “f” along with the expression that it evaluates. `Backend.ExpressionReader` will then return this `Backend.FunctionExpression` which will then be added to the `Backend.Axes` object.

The `Renderer` takes an `Backend.Axes` (currently just an `Backend.Expression`), a `Viewpoint`, and other parameters for the desired image (such as size, scales of axes, etc), then generates an int[] array representing pixels of an image. `RendererUseCase` will pass the parameters of the image to `Renderer` which will then convert the pixel array into an image and save it to a file.

#### Renderer Demo Results

*What each group member has been working on and plans to work on next?*

AST/Backend.Expression implementation: Dihan, Rishibh, Ted, Omar

- Creating the Backend.Expression class that represents a given function as an abstract syntax tree.
- For a given input string representing an expression, creating the Backend.ExpressionReader and Backend.ExpressionCreator classes to build the function AST.
- To-do

  - AST operations like function composition
  - Other mathematical operations e.g. trigonometry, logarithms
  - Clean up code
  - Handling brackets more appropriately
  - Handling constants like pi and e
- Graphics/Graphing: Kevin, Louis, Binseong, Andrew

  - Created basic 2D implicit Grapher
  - 3D SDF Raymarcher
  - Will try extending Raymarcher to arbitrary implicit functions
  - 3D - adjustable lighting, shadows etc
  - 2D - color gradients etc
  - Will try OpenGL or GUI
- ExpressionReader: Omar and Ted
- Testing: Omar, Binseong


*What has worked well so far with your design as you have started implementing the code?*

  - Having a recursive structure for Expressions works really well
  - Having modularity between the ASTs and Renderer classes means that we can have groups working on them independently 

*Have you clearly indicated at least one open question your group is struggling with, so that your TA can address it in their feedback for phase 0?*

  - Categorizing classes by clean architecture (especially with controllers and use cases)
