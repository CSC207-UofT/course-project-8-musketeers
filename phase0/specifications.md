# Project Abacus

### Specifications

A User should be able to:

- actually evaluate basic expressions like 3 + 5

- graph functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ and restrict its domain
- graph functions in 3D, so $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ and again be able to restrict domains
- graph implicit functions, i.e. functions of the form $f(x,y) = 0$ and $f(x, y, z) = 0$.
- plot multiple graphs on the same set of axes
- do operations on the functions they define, i.e. if they have a function $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, they should be able to plot $f(x) + g(x), f(x) - g(x), f(x)g(x), \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}, f(g(x))$ 
- zoom in and out of graph
- be able to rotate viewpoint around for 3D graphs



Possible extensions:

- Plotting parametric curves and surfaces
- Plotting complex functions
- Plotting vector fields
- Finding derivatives and integrals
